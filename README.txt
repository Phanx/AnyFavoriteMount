Any Favorite Mount
=====================

Lets you set any mount as a favorite, even if the default UI doesn't.

The default UI doesn't let you set certain mounts as favorites, like
warlocks' Dreadsteed. This is annoying. Therefore, this addon was
written. It should be totally transparent to the user, and should work
with all mount-related addons. Just right-click any mount and set/remove
it as a favorite. These "special" favorites are stored per character.

Available on [Curse] [1] and [WoWInterface] [2].
