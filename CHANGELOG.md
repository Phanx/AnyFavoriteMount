### Version 6.0.3.6

* Fully replaced the default summoning logic to make sure ground mounts are never summoned in flying areas.
* Also added logic to avoid summoning most flying mounts in non-flying areas, because they look bad flopping around on the ground. Wyverns, I'm looking at you!

### Version 6.0.3.5

* Minor update

### Version 6.0.3.4

* First public release
