### Version 7.0.3.2

* Flying mounts will now be used in your garrison if you have Draenor Pathfinder.
* Using the "Summon Random Favorite Mount" action while already mounted will now dismount you (same as the default UI).

### Version 7.0.3.1

* Fixed an error that could occur at login with other mount-related addons.

### Version 7.0.3.0

* Updated for WoW 7.0 (Legion)

### Version 6.2.2.12

* Fixed flying in garrisons with Draenor Pathfinder.
* Added support for the Chauffeured Chopper.

### Version 6.2.2.11

* Fixed dragging and dropping the Summon Random Favorite Mount button from the mount journal to an action button. This now creates a macro named "Mount" that is compatible with Any Favorite Mount. You may edit the macro after it has been created. If you already have a macro named "Mount", that will be used instead of creating a new one.

### Version 6.0.3.10

* Fixed an issue causing special favorites to be excluded while swimming.

### Version 6.0.3.9

* Ashran: also not flyable, act II.

### Version 6.0.3.8

* Garrisons: also not flyable.

### Version 6.0.3.7

* No, Blizzard, Draenor is not flyable either.

### Version 6.0.3.6

* Fully replaced the default summoning logic to make sure ground mounts are never summoned in flying areas.
* Also added logic to avoid summoning most flying mounts in non-flying areas, because they look bad flopping around on the ground. Wyverns, I'm looking at you!

### Version 6.0.3.5

* Minor update

### Version 6.0.3.4

* First public release
